so okay the the modal where we're doing confirmations is now a little bit more camp-packed I can actually see the see the submit button for it which is good the one like there's a couple things that are still wrong with it so the time and the title for the task if the task is small enough so if it's in like 15 minute increments then it doesn't actually like the border around it doesn't actually cover both of those things so it would actually be more preferable if we had the time in time and title in the same row so that way even if the the time block is small like 15 minutes it it'll still it'll still like show properly the other thing we can do is also just like expand the height between the hours rate so like between one two three four like like PM like like just expand all the expand the space vertically so that we can have a little bit more breathing room especially for like events that might overlap and then the other thing is that when I go over to the list view it doesn't sync with the drag and drop that I do in the calendar view and the drag and drop view actually doesn't really work that well like it doesn't really work right so like I still can't like properly drag things on the on the timeline on the calendar view rather and so I want you to debug that and like you figure out why it's not working properly I should just be able to drag and drop into the time slots that I want and that list view should sync up with it also I don't want a duration for the list view I want it starting and end time so that way I can just kind of keep things organized and then the other thing is that I want to be able to delete stuff right when I'm in the I'm in the calendar view or the list view I want to be able to delete stuff and I also want to be able to add tasks right that that I want so I'm not sure how exactly we're we're gonna do that but actually just just forget about the adding task when we're in the confirmation model just forget about that part just worry about whether or not we can actually remove the task and then you know the editing part just comes in and then the calendar view where I can drag and drop and then in the list view where I can change the starting and end date maybe the list view we can add like a plus button where like we just add another item in that list and so I can just add something which has a title starting an end time and that way I can just also dynamically add stuff that the the LLM might have not picked up so these are all the things that we still need to improve
